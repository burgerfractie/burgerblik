### Data Structure

The archive is organized chronologically. The structure is: `/YYYY/MM_MonthName/`. 

File names follow the convention: `YYYY-MM-DD_START-END_DEBATE-TYPE_TOPIC_SUBTOPIC_CHAMBER.xxx`

Each debate consists of two files:
* **`.srt`**: The original subtitle file with precise timestamps for verification.
* **`.txt`**: A clean, readable transcript generated from the source file.

### Disclaimer

Please note: these transcripts are AI-generated and may contain errors. They serve as a searchable archive. For direct quotes, always verify with the original video source.
